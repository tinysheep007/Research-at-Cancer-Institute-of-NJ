# Computational Genomics Resource Development / Visualizing Chromosomal Data for Cancer Diagnostics 🧬

**Cancer is fundamentally rooted in genetic mutations.** By examining chromosomal data, researchers can trace the origins of these mutations, revealing critical insights into cancer development. Chromosomes, which carry genetic material, undergo mutations that influence cellular behavior and disease progression. Visualizing genomic data before advanced analyses, like machine learning, is essential to accurately interpret patterns and anomalies.
